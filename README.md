# React App Starter

Basic react app starter with webpack and Browser Sync.

Quick start:

```
$ npm install
$ npm run build
````

## Development

Run Webpack in watch-mode to continually compile the JavaScript as you work:

```
$ npm run watch
```

Main files from Bob Ziroll's React tutorial on Scrimba. Modified to use Browser Sync for hot reloading.
